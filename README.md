# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and usage data, the model identifies customers who are likely to leave, enabling the company to take proactive measures.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains customer information such as:
- Demographics (age, gender, region)
- Account details (contract type, tenure, billing)
- Usage patterns (calls, internet usage)
- Customer support interactions  

Files included in this repository:
- `customer_churn.ipynb` – The main Jupyter notebook with the analysis and model implementation.
- `telecom_churn.csv` – The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `ROC.png` – ROC curve plot for model performance evaluation.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection  
4. Model Training and Evaluation (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Model Performance Analysis using metrics like Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MARUTHI-VARA-PRASAD/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
